  <!-- EN: The roughest, toughest, most unreliable mercenaries, assassins, freeloaders and assholes this side of the cosmos. The Greytide was formed after the great Nanotrasen unenployment crisis left its mark, this meant thousands of untrained men and woman unable to find an appropriate job to feed themselves and their spess families. The tide initially was treated as such a threat that many of those who participated in its movement were sent to Nanotrasen prison rocks and forced to labor for life, even to this day the Greytide still holds one of the largest population of members in the galaxy. While quite rash, brutal and unthinking in their actions they are simplistic and therefore can be easy to please with materialistic objects. -->
  <Greytide.description>宇宙中最粗暴、最强悍、最不可靠的雇佣兵、刺客、白吃白喝者和混蛋。灰潮成立于纳诺特拉森失业危机之后，这意味着成千上万未经训练的男女无法找到合适的工作来养活自己和家人。起初，灰潮被视为一种威胁，许多参与其运动的人都被送往纳诺特拉森监狱岩，被迫终身服劳役，即使到了今天，灰潮仍然是银河系中成员最多的组织之一。虽然他们的行为相当鲁莽、粗暴、不假思索，但他们很简单，因此很容易被物质所取悦。</Greytide.description>
